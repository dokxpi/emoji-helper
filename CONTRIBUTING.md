Thanks for contributing to this project! :heart:

## How can I contribute?

You can contribute by reporting bugs, testing bug reports from other people or by helping out with coding!

### Bug reports

_If you encounter any bug, please be sure to test it in a clean profile of your webbrowser, without other extensions interfering._

If you would like to help, try confirming bug reports of other people. Bug reports that can be confirmed by someone else will get a `confirmed-bug` badge.

### Code

Good issues to tackle are marked with `help wanted` in the issue tracker. Please leave a comment if you're planning to work on it.

I will help you get into the codebase anytime, but you will also quickly find that it's not very complicated. Even if you are relatively new to programming it should not be hard to implement small features.

Be sure to check out the README on [Development](https://github.com/johannhof/emoji-helper#development) and [Testing](https://github.com/johannhof/emoji-helper#testing)

Again, please ask if anything is unclear.
